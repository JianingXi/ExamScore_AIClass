Abstract	This paper focuses on cutting-edge natural language processing technologies based on large language models, systematically exploring their research background, technical bottlenecks, domestic and international advancements, core principles, and application potential. In terms of research background, large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks through massive data pre-training, becoming a core driving force in the NLP field. However, challenges such as high model training costs, suboptimal reliability of generated content, and prominent privacy and ethical risks urgently need to be addressed. The study reviews breakthrough international achievements from 2020 to 2023, including GPT-3 and PaLM, as well as domestic technological deployments by companies like Baidu's ERNIE Bot and ByteDance's Doubao under policy support, analyzing industry development trends. At the methodological level, the paper elaborates on core algorithms based on Transformer architecture and self-attention mechanisms, comparing them with traditional NLP approaches to highlight the advantages of large language models in accuracy and generalization capabilities. In the experimental section, 200 sentiment text samples were collected for text classification experiments using Python and mainstream libraries, achieving an average accuracy of 0.85 through five-fold cross-validation, with a t-test p-value below 0.05, validating the model's effectiveness. The research demonstrates that large language models have revolutionized the paradigm of natural language processing, yet continuous exploration is needed in technical optimization and ethical guidelines. Their application prospects in intelligent customer service, healthcare, finance, and other fields are vast, holding significant importance for advancing NLP theory and technology.
