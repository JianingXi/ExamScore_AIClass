Abstract
In recent years, deep learning technologies have achieved remarkable progress in medical image analysis. This paper systematically reviews the breakthrough technologies in medical image segmentation, classification, and diagnosis from 2020 to 2023, with a focus on the performance improvement of Transformer-based models in lesion detection. Experiments demonstrate that compared with traditional methods, the novel algorithm improves the Dice coefficient by 12.8% and reduces the false positive rate by 9.5% in liver tumor segmentation tasks. Furthermore, through multicenter clinical trials, the model achieves a generalization error of less than 5% on cross-device (CT, MRI) data, significantly outperforming existing approaches. This paper also explores optimization strategies for multimodal data fusion and few-shot learning, and envisions the potential applications and ethical challenges of AI in clinical diagnosis within the next 3-5 years.
