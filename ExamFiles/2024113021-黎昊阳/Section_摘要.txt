Abstract
To address the challenges of delayed response to dynamic obstacles and low efficiency in multi-vehicle collaboration during AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) path planning in traditional warehousing logistics, this study proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (MARPOL) integrated with an attention mechanism. By constructing a hierarchical state representation space, designing a dynamic reward function, and optimizing multi-agent communication mechanisms, the algorithm achieves an average path length reduction of 22.3%, a dynamic obstacle avoidance success rate of 98.1%, and a computational delay within 150ms in warehouse environment simulations. Experimental results demonstrate that the method significantly enhances the real-time decision-making capability and robustness of intelligent warehousing systems in complex scenarios, providing theoretical and technical support for the large-scale application of smart logistics.
