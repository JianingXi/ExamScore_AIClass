Abstract:This paper focuses on an in - depth investigation of the frontier progress of natural language processing based on large language models. Firstly, it elaborates on the significance of this research in the field of natural language processing, analyzes the existing technical bottlenecks, and clarifies its theoretical value and application scenarios. Subsequently, it introduces the breakthrough technologies from 2020 to 2023 and the latest achievements of well - known laboratories internationally, as well as the national policy support and the technical layout of leading enterprises domestically. The principles and methods of the core algorithms are described in detail, with mathematical expressions, flowcharts, and quantitative comparisons with traditional methods. Through the collection of self - generated data, analysis using Python and mainstream libraries, visualization with charts, and verification of significance by cross - validation, the research results are presented. Finally, a summary and outlook are provided from the perspectives of technology, application, and ethics. The research shows that large language models exhibit great potential in natural language processing, but also face many challenges. Continuous exploration is needed in the future for technical optimization, application expansion, and ethical standardization.
