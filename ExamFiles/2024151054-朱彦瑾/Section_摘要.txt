Abstract	Multimodal large models (MLLMs) have become a research hotspot in artificial intelligence by fusing cross-media data such as text, images, and speech to break through the semantic gap of single-modal analysis. This paper focuses on the technological evolution of MLLMs in scenarios such as cross-media retrieval, content generation, and emotion analysis, systematically analyzing the bottlenecks of existing models in feature alignment, computational efficiency, and generalization ability. By constructing an autonomous dataset containing 500 image-text pairs and conducting comparative experiments based on the CLIP model, the results show that the improved multimodal fusion method increases the accuracy of cross-media retrieval by 23% compared with traditional methods (p<0.01). The research provides theoretical support and technical pathways for scenarios such as intelligent recommendation and virtual reality.
