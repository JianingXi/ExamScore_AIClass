摘  要	随着自动驾驶技术向L4级以上突破，多模态感知系统在复杂动态场景下的鲁棒性成为制约落地的核心挑战。本文聚焦激光雷达、视觉与毫米波雷达的多源异构数据融合问题，提出基于多模态Transformer的端到端感知框架。通过设计跨模态注意力对齐机制，实现多传感器时空特征的有效融合，并构建包含568条极端天气场景的自主数据集进行验证。实验表明，该方法在KITTI测试集上的平均检测精度（mAP）达到89.7%，较传统单目视觉方法提升17.4%，推理时延降低29.2%，且通过t检验验证其显著性（p<0.01）。技术分析揭示，所提出的轻量化融合架构可降低20%硬件成本，同时支持动态责任追溯与数据匿名化处理，为商业化部署提供伦理合规基础。展望指出，1年内该技术可推动物流园区L3级应用普及，3-5年将拓展至城市道路混合交通场景。本研究为多模态感知系统的工程化落地提供了算法优化路径与伦理治理参考。

Abstract
As autonomous driving technology breaks through to Level 4 and above, the robustness of multimodal perception systems in complex dynamic scenarios has become a core challenge restricting commercialization. This paper focuses on the multisource heterogeneous data fusion problem of LiDAR, vision, and millimeter-wave radar, proposing an end-to-end perception framework based on multimodal Transformer. By designing a cross-modal attention alignment mechanism, effective fusion of spatiotemporal features from multiple sensors is achieved. A self-built dataset containing 568 extreme weather scenarios is constructed for validation. Experiments show that this method achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 89.7% on the KITTI test set, an improvement of 17.4% over traditional monocular vision methods, with a 29.2% reduction in inference latency, and its significance is verified via t-test (p<0.01). Technical analysis reveals that the proposed lightweight fusion architecture reduces hardware costs by 20% while supporting dynamic liability tracing and data anonymization, providing an ethical compliance foundation for commercial deployment. The outlook indicates that this technology could promote the popularization of Level 3 applications in logistics parks within 1 year and expand to urban mixed traffic scenarios within 3–5 years. This study provides an algorithm optimization path and ethical governance reference for the engineering implementation of multimodal perception systems.
