Abstract	With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, the field of medical image analysis is undergoing revolutionary changes. This paper focuses on the cutting-edge technologies of deep learning in medical image analysis. Firstly, it expounds its importance in the AI field and points out the bottlenecks of existing technologies in few-shot learning, multimodal fusion, and generalization ability. Then, it analyzes the research status at home and abroad from the aspects of international breakthrough technologies, achievements of well-known laboratories, domestic policy support, and technical layout of leading enterprises. Next, the core algorithm formula is given, the technical implementation path diagram is drawn by Visio, and the quantitative comparison of time complexity and accuracy with traditional methods is carried out. By collecting 50 medical image sample data, using Python and mainstream libraries for experimental analysis, and using visual charts and cross-validation to verify the significance of the results. Finally, the technical progress is summarized, its applications in different time dimensions are prospected, and the ethical issues of AI governance are considered.
