Abstract	In the context of the digital transformation of the medical field, the volume of medical image data is growing exponentially, and artificial intelligence (AI) technology brings new opportunities for medical image analysis. This study focuses on the bottlenecks of data quality and model interpretability in the application of AI in medical image analysis. Multisource data fusion and standardized processing techniques are adopted to improve data consistency, and methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are combined to enhance the transparency of model decision - making. Experiments show that the accuracy of the model is improved by 15% with the fused data, and the interpretability of the XAI method reaches 80%. The research results can improve the theory of AI in medical image analysis, and are expected to optimize the image analysis process in scenarios such as clinical diagnosis and telemedicine, contribute to precision medicine, and provide support for the rational allocation of medical resources.
current research status both domestically and internationally, analyzing the core algorithm principles and methods, and verifying the performance through experiments, it is found that deep learning technology shows significant advantages in medical image analysis. However, challenges still exist in data privacy protection and model interpretability. The technical summary and application prospects proposed in this paper provide references for the future development of medical image analysis technology.
