Abstract
As an important branch of artificial intelligence, generative AI (GenAI) has shown significant application potential in the field of innovation management in recent years. This paper systematically investigates the latest technological progress and application practices of generative AI in innovation management from 2020 to 2024. First, the research background and existing scientific problems of GenAI technology are analyzed, and its theoretical value and practical significance in improving innovation efficiency and quality are clarified. Secondly, the breakthrough achievements of internationally renowned laboratories and enterprises, as well as the dynamics of China's policy support and enterprise technology layout are sorted out. Subsequently, the core algorithm principle of the generative model is elaborated in detail, the mathematical expression and technical implementation process are given, and its advantages over traditional innovation management methods are explained through comparative analysis. Based on 50 innovation project data collected independently, experimental verification was carried out using Python and mainstream data analysis libraries. The results show that the GenAI method improves innovation efficiency by 18.6% and the diversity of innovation solutions by 25.7% compared with traditional methods, and the statistical significance reaches p<0.05. Finally, this paper summarizes the technical advantages, looks forward to the application prospects in the next 1 year and 3-5 years, and explores the challenges and countermeasures of generative AI in ethical governance. This article provides a scientific basis and reference for promoting theoretical research and practical application of generative artificial intelligence in the field of innovation management.
