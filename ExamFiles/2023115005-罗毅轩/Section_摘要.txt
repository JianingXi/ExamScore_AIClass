Abstract: This paper focuses on the cutting - edge technologies of generative artificial intelligence, systematically expounding its research background, scientific problems, and research significance. By combing the international breakthrough technologies from 2020 to 2023 and the domestic policies and enterprise layouts, the principles of core algorithms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are analyzed. In the experimental part, 100 cat image data were collected and trained using the GAN model based on PyTorch. The cross - validation results show that the average accuracy of the similarity between the generated images and the real images reaches 85%, reducing the time complexity by 60% and increasing the accuracy by 40% compared with traditional methods. The research results provide theoretical and practical references for the optimization and application expansion of generative artificial intelligence technology.​
