摘  要	本文聚焦人工智能前沿技术的核心进展与挑战，系统梳理了2020-2025年全球AI领域的技术突破、应用场景及治理框架。研究显示，基于Transformer架构的多模态大模型（如Google Gemini、OpenAI Q*）通过混合专家（MoE）与强化学习技术，显著提升了跨模态语义对齐能力，推动医疗影像分析、科学计算等领域的智能化进程。然而，技术瓶颈依然存在，包括模型训练成本激增（千亿参数模型训练成本＞460万美元）、算法可解释性不足以及伦理风险加剧（如AI生成内容的版权争议与数据隐私泄露）。国内政策层面，中国通过“新一代人工智能”重大项目投入23.6亿元支持核心技术研发，百度ERNIE-ViL 2.0与腾讯混元大模型在中文多模态任务中表现卓越，但算力芯片依赖进口的问题亟待解决。国际治理方面，2025年巴黎AI峰会暴露了美欧在监管模式上的分歧，美国“科工复合体”加速技术垄断，而欧盟则强调刚性立法以平衡创新与安全。未来，AI将向自主决策智能体（Agentic AI）、具身智能（Embodied AI）及AI4Science方向演进，同时需构建全球协同的伦理治理体系以应对失控性风险。

Abstract	This paper focuses on the core progress and challenges of cutting-edge AI technologies, and systematically reviews the technological breakthroughs, application scenarios, and governance frameworks in the global AI field from 2020 to 2025. The research shows that multi-modal large models based on Transformer architecture (such as Google Gemini and OpenAI Q*) significantly improve the ability of cross-modal semantic alignment through hybrid expert (MoE) and reinforcement learning technology, and promote the intelligent process in the fields of medical image analysis and scientific computing. However, technical bottlenecks remain, including the proliferation of model training costs ($4.6 million > the cost of training 100 billion parameter models), insufficient interpretability of algorithms, and heightened ethical risks (such as copyright disputes and data privacy breaches of AI-generated content). At the domestic policy level, China has invested 2.36 billion yuan to support core technology research and development through the major project of "new generation artificial intelligence", and Baidu ERNIE-ViL 2.0 and Tencent's hybrid model have performed well in Chinese multimodal tasks, but the problem of dependence on imports of computing power chips needs to be solved urgently. In terms of international governance, the 2025 Paris AI Summit exposed the differences between the US and the EU over regulatory models, with the US "science-industry complex" accelerating technology monopolies, while the EU emphasizing rigid legislation to balance innovation and security. In the future, AI will evolve to Agentic AI, Embodied AI, and AI4Science, and a globally coordinated ethical governance system needs to be built to deal with the risk of loss of control.
