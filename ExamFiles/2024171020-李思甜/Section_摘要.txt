Abstract	In the era of the deep integration of medical data and artificial intelligence, the contradiction between data privacy and collaborative model training is prominent. Federated learning has become the key to solving this problem. This research deeply analyzes its application in the medical field and proposes innovative strategies for the challenges of data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and privacy protection. By collecting 200 cases of multi - source medical data and conducting experiments using Python and mainstream libraries, the results show that the improved federated learning model has increased the accuracy by 18% and reduced the communication cost by 40%, effectively verifying the effectiveness of the strategies and providing strong support for the secure and efficient use of medical data.
