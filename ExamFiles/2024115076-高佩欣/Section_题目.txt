Frontier Breakthroughs and Application Expansion of Clustering Algorithms in Epidemiology and Health Statistics
NAME：Gao PeiXin
英文摘要：
This paper delves into the frontier breakthroughs and application expansion of clustering algorithms in the field of epidemiology and health statistics, highlighting their pivotal role in advancing public health research and practice.
In recent years, the exponential growth of medical data, including disease surveillance records, clinical datasets, and genomic sequences, has created an urgent demand for advanced data analysis techniques. Clustering algorithms, as a fundamental tool in artificial intelligence (AI), have emerged as a powerful means of uncovering hidden patterns and structures within these complex datasets. However, several technical challenges persist. High-dimensional data, such as gene expression profiles with thousands of dimensions, pose significant hurdles, often leading to the curse of dimensionality and suboptimal clustering performance. Moreover, the presence of noise and outliers in clinical data can distort results, while the computational inefficiency of existing algorithms struggles to meet the real-time analysis requirements of large-scale, continuously updated epidemic data.
Internationally, from 2020 to 2023, remarkable breakthroughs have been achieved. Deep learning-based clustering methods, such as the Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) algorithm, have been applied to gene expression data analysis, enabling precise identification of disease subtypes. Temporal-spatial clustering techniques integrating GIS and time-series analysis have enhanced the accuracy of epidemic spread prediction. Notable achievements also come from renowned laboratories. The bioinformatics laboratory at Harvard Medical School developed a multi-omics integration clustering framework, successfully identifying novel disease molecular subtypes, which was published in *Nature Medicine*. The Public Health Laboratory at the University of Cambridge optimized clustering algorithms using reinforcement learning, improving the effectiveness of influenza vaccination strategies.
In China, strong policy support has been provided to promote the application of clustering algorithms in health statistics, as emphasized in the *Healthy China 2030 Plan Outline*. Leading enterprises, including Huawei and Tencent, have actively entered the medical big data field. Huawei's medical data intelligent analysis platform, integrated with an improved K-means algorithm, can rapidly process large-scale electronic medical records for disease risk stratification. Tencent's AI-assisted diagnosis system applies hierarchical clustering to medical image data, enhancing diagnostic efficiency.
Three core clustering algorithms, K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering, are comprehensively introduced. The K-means algorithm aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares, with a time complexity reduced to \(O(nkt)\) in its improved version, compared to the traditional hierarchical clustering's \(O(n^{3})\). In terms of accuracy, for example, the DBSCAN algorithm demonstrated a 15% increase in identifying abnormal data in disease gene expression data over the traditional K-means algorithm.
In the experimental section, 120 clinical data samples of diabetes patients were collected and generated. Using Python and libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, data preprocessing, including missing value imputation and normalization, was conducted. Clustering results were visualized using scatter plots and heatmaps. Through 10-fold cross-validation, the average silhouette coefficient of DBSCAN reached 0.72, significantly outperforming K-means (0.65) and hierarchical clustering (0.60), with a p-value < 0.05 confirmed by t-test.
In conclusion, clustering algorithms have proven effective in analyzing medical data, yet improvements are needed in high-dimensional data handling and interpretability. In the short term (within 1 year), they will be more widely used in disease diagnosis assistance and epidemic monitoring. In the medium term (3 - 5 years), their application in drug development and public health policy-making will deepen. However, ethical considerations, such as data privacy protection and algorithmic fairness, must be addressed to ensure the secure and reliable use of these technologies.
