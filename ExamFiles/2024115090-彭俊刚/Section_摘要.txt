摘  要	针对糖尿病并发症预测中多模态数据质量差、关联规则因果性缺失等关键问题，本研究提出融合医学本体清洗与因果发现的智能预警系统。首先构建UMLS本体指导的三级数据清洗管道，解决EHR中32%的缺失值与矛盾记录；进而提出因果关联度（CAR）指标，将PC算法与改进Apriori结合，从130万条病历中挖掘21种因果规则；最后开发动态加权集成分类器（XGBoost+TimeBERT+GraphSAGE），通过Shapley值实现特征自适应融合。在58例临床数据与合成数据集上的实验表明：①数据清洗效率较传统方法提升3.2倍；②因果规则临床认可率达89%（较FP-Growth提升41%）；③并发症预测AUC达0.934（p<0.001）。该系统已通过三甲医院伦理审查，为糖尿病风险管理提供首个同时满足数据可靠性、规则可解释性及预测准确性的AI解决方案。摘要

Abstract	To address critical challenges in diabetes complication prediction, including poor multimodal data quality and lack of causal validity in association rules, this study proposes an intelligent early-warning system integrating medical ontology-based cleaning with causal discovery. We first construct a three-stage data cleaning pipeline guided by UMLS ontology, resolving 32% missing/conflicting records in EHRs. Then, a novel Causal Association Ratio (CAR) metric is proposed by combining PC algorithm with enhanced Apriori, extracting 21 causal rules from 1.3 million records. Finally, a dynamically weighted ensemble classifier (XGBoost+TimeBERT+GraphSAGE) is developed with Shapley-based feature fusion. Experiments on 58 clinical cases and synthetic datasets show: ① 3.2× faster data cleaning than conventional methods; ② 89% clinical acceptance rate for causal rules (41% improvement over FP-Growth); ③ 0.934 prediction AUC for complications (p<0.001). As the first AI solution simultaneously ensuring data reliability, rule interpretability and prediction accuracy, this system has passed ethical review in tertiary hospitals, demonstrating significant clinical translation value.
